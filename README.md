# HydraBot

## About Hydra

Hydra is a multipurpose Discord bot written in Python. Hydra was made to simplify moderation and to provide many other "
general" features.

## Contributions and Issue/Bug Reporting

*Hydra is still in development. Please report any bugs you find to the Github issue tracker. Since Hydra is open source,
you can fork the code and modify the bot to your liking. You can also make contributions to the main project by forking
this repo, making your changes, and then submitting a pull request.*
